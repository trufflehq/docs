# Orgs

## How does it work?

At the center of the Truffle platform are **Orgs**. An Org houses all of the information about a creator's organization and their users. Each user in their user base is called an **OrgUser**.

{% hint style="info" %}
We call a user of an org an "OrgUser" because we reserve the term "User" to refer to a user of the Truffle platform as a whole.
{% endhint %}

You might be asking yourself at this point, "but how to these OrgUsers actually use Truffle?"

The answer is through **Packages**! A package represents a collection of features that a creator can add to their Org. A package could serve as the creator's website, or it could be a more specialized feature like one that facilitates giveaways for their users. The possibilities for packages are endless, allowing you, the developer, to create any type of feature that a creator would want!&#x20;

We'll talk more in depth about packages later, but for now, know that packages provide the features that make an Org come to life.
