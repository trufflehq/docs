# How packages work

Everything in Truffle is considered a package. We chose the name package, because it's most familiar for us as developers, but you can also think of packages as "apps" or "products".

Each creator on Truffle is considered an "organization". Within each organization, there are "packages" (aka "products"). For example, the "Myth" organization has a "site" package that serves up mogul-menu (the extension menu package with channel points, etc...), raid-overlay, and a few other packages.

Eg. [https://myth.truffle.site/mogul-menu](https://myth.truffle.site/mogul-menu) and [https://myth.truffle.site/raid-overlay](https://myth.truffle.site/raid-overlay)

Same for the "PointCrow" organization and "site" package with [https://pointcrow.truffle.site/mogul-menu](https://pointcrow.truffle.site/mogul-menu) and [https://pointcrow.truffle.site/raid-overlay](https://pointcrow.truffle.site/raid-overlay)

mogul-menu and raid-overlay are two packages we've built that other creators can install and use.
