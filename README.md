# Overview

## Welcome!

Welcome to the Truffle Developer Platform - we’re stoked you’re here!

We’re building out the infrastructure that’ll make it easy for you to build cool shit for creators :)

Long-term our primary goal is to build this in a way that you can build an entire lucrative business on top of Truffle - similar to how many very successful businesses have started by building on top of Shopify.



## Wtf is Truffle?

A lot of folks know of Truffle as the browser extension, but it’s a whole lot more than that! We want to help creators build their own businesses. YouTube and Twitch are great, but **creators should be able to have more ownership and grow their own userbases** vs only ever helping the billion dollar companies grow theirs.

Truffle is the infrastructure to make that possible. At our core, we’re focused on helping creators 1) grow their userbase, 2) engage their userbase, and 3) monetize.

But because there’s such a broad range of creators, we’re focused on the core infrastructure to make this possible, and using the developer platform as the vehicle for the real magic to happen.

## What can I build?

A lot. But to start out and keep things simple, we're steering developers in the direction of building functionality that can improve creators' content directly on YouTube or Twitch.

Think of it as a more powerful Twitch extension, that works for YouTube and Twitch streamers.
