# Overview

## Welcome!

Welcome to the Truffle Developer Platform - we’re stoked you’re here!

We’re building out the infrastructure that’ll make it easy for you to build cool shit for creators :)

**To start, we're making it easy for you to build "apps" that creators can use in their stream** (similar to the concept of Twitch extensions)

You'll be able to charge for these apps, or keep them free. And in the early days we'll work on other incentives like bounties (ideas we know creators want, that we'll pay to have built)

## Wtf is Truffle?

A lot of folks know of Truffle as the browser extension, but it’s a whole lot more than that! We want to help creators build their own businesses. YouTube and Twitch are great, but **creators should be able to have more ownership and grow their own userbases**.

Truffle is the infrastructure to make that possible. At our core, we’re focused on helping creators 1) grow their userbase, 2) engage their userbase, and 3) monetize.

But because there’s such a broad range of creators, we’re focused on the core infrastructure to make this possible, and using the developer platform as the vehicle for the real magic to happen.

## What can I build?

A lot. But to start out and keep things simple, we're steering developers in the direction of building functionality that can improve creators' content directly on YouTube or Twitch.

Think of it as a more powerful Twitch extension, that works for YouTube **and** Twitch streamers.
