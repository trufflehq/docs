# Events

#### **Events**

Inside the Truffle API weâ€™ve built out a system to create and subscribe to events that happen inside of Truffle. The core models that the event system consists of are Event Topics, Event Subscriptions, and Actions which you can compose to create highly customizable experiences and interactions between the Truffle API and 3rd party packages.
