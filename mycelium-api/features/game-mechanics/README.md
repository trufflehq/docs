# Game Mechanics

Game Mechanics are one of the core aspects of Truffle that we believe create rich experiences between creators and their viewers. These models are used to create entire digital economies ranging from battle passes where viewers can level up and earn rewards by watching livestreams or other video content, a Twitch-like channel points system where viewers can unlock items and participate in predictions during live streams, or completely custom economies and game mechanics like an in-game currency for a Minecraft server.

The core models to power experiences centered around game mechanics are Powerups, Collectibles, OrgUserCounters, and EconomyActions as well as more specific models like the SeasonPass and SeasonPassProgression which power battle pass like concepts.
