# @hasPermission

The `@hasPermission {...}` is used to restrict mutations/resolvers to users, api keys, and packages that have a specified permission. For user access, these permissions are managed in the Org admin dashboard and for package API keys these permissions are managed by the requested permissions for a PackageVersion and the role created during a package install.
